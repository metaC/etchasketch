# etchasketch
Just a test implementing an etchasketch using an arduino nano and various sensors 

## sketch.py 

+ Uses arduino nano
+ Uses 1 KY-040 rotary encoder (controlled via the code in arduino_sketch) (this is no longer true, I deleted the original code)
+ Switches between horizantal and vertical using the button on the KY-040 to switch modes

## sketch_2.py

+ Uses arduino nano
+ Uses 2 KY-040s to control horz and vert movement. 
+ Requires both to connect to the same 5v pin on a arudino nano.
